# Binary-Cellular-Automata-Generator-For-Any-Rule-1Dimensional-Oct-2018
Java code that generates any of the 256 elementary CAs discovered by Stephen Wolfram

## Introduction
The code generates an ever expanding carpet of binary 2 dimensional cellular automata, Cellular Automata are important in modelling complex systems

## Output of the Code

The code outputs into a .txt file, i copied the output into a word document to edit line spacings and font size to make the patterns more clear
This is rule 110 generated by the code:

This is rule 30:

I left the MSWord UI to show how i used it to edit spacing and font size just like regular text editing.
